# PredictingElectricityConsumption-
-  Forecasting  the electricity  consumption using time series techniques  
- The file Elec-train.xlsx contains electricity consumption (kW) and outdoor air temperature for one building.
These quantities are measured every 15 minutes, from 1/1/2010 1:15 to 2/17/2010 23:45. In addition, outdoor
air temperature are available for 2/18/2010. The goal is to forecast electricity consumption (kW) for
2/18/2010
